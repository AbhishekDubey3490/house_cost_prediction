# House Price Prediction Model
This project predicts house prices using a machine learning model.
Developed a machine learning model to predict house prices based on features like location, size, and amenities.
Preprocessed and cleaned the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and normalize features.
Used multiple regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees) to compare and optimize prediction
accuracy.
Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared, improving prediction
accuracy through hyperparameter tuning.
